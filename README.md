# Sauce-and-Spoon-Tablets-Launch

## Project Overview
Sauce & Spoon was my capstone project for the Google Project Management Profestional Certificate program. I acted the project manager (Peta), managing the launch of Menu tablets at two restaurant locations. The scenario for the project was:

Sauce & Spoon is a small restaurant chain that wants to meet its annual growth and expansion goals. As one way to meet these goals, theyâ€™ve decided to launch a pilot project to test out the impact of installing new tabletop menu tablets. The new menu tablets will allow the restaurant to serve more guests in less time and will also provide valuable data that will help Sauce & Spoon meet its business goals.
